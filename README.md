### Version Links

- [🌟 **Version 1**](https://yhlk.github.io/population-datavisu/v1/)

- [🚀 **Version 2**](https://yhlk.github.io/population-datavisu/v2/)

There's two versions, wanted to add a third with geojson to view population when hovering over the map. Thought it would be cool to be able to display more information about the countries when hovering over.
